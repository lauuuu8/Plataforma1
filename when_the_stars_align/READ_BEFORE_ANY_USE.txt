When The Stars Align is an elegant script with a calm, luminous presence.

Its letterforms flow smoothly, with gentle contrast and carefully shaped curves that give the text a sense of balance and intention. The rhythm is unhurried, allowing words to breathe while still feeling connected and deliberate. Subtle swashes and soft joins add character without drawing attention away from the message.

The overall impression is romantic and thoughtful, as if written under a clear night sky. It suits moments that call for warmth and sincerity, where the lettering should feel personal but refined, like a handwritten note saved for something meaningful.

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability. 
It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from North Europa to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers. 

Designed by Mans Greback, this font was created with a focus on flow and clarity. The goal was to capture a natural script feeling while keeping the shapes consistent and usable across different sizes and settings.
